Initially it made sense to watch YouTube videos on what to study, but they don't really discuss **why** certain things are important. I think the best approach if I had to start this year over is to know that I should storm through a basic HTML/CSS/JS course. Thereafter, learn the React framework from some sort of course.

Another important factor that isn't mentioned is that _you don't have to finish_ the course and every lesson 100%. Some things are not well suited for the Pareto principle, so you end up getting **more confused** that you need to be.

From here on, attempting to create a project from scratch is a daunting task. I'm not sure if it's a better idea to modify an existing project/template or to start something absolutely from scratch. Rather than being stuck, I'm deciding to modify an existing practice project like this "blog" tutorial I found on the Next.js website.
