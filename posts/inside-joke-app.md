This is a sort of running note of what this idea could turn into. My essence of this app is to be a management system for inside jokes in a group of people. I'm not exactly sure the other use cases, but being able to take "mental notes" or "written pictures" of moments in collaboration with friends can lead to great memories and a fun hang out idea once there's content added periodically.

- Feed of the newest and or highest rated things being added.
- Ability to add media to each post with possible title cards including the media on the feed.
- Voting system to approve new additions and or removals.
- Timeline feature to see how humor or additions have evolved.
- Memories feature similar to Snapchat or Facebook.

The ideal experience would be to open the app and start scrolling through the most recent jokes added. Maybe multiple tabs at the bottom like Instagram to see group chat, new additions, memories, different views (timeline, grouped additions, etc.)
